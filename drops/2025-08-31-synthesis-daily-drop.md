**North Star Anchor**  
In 10,000 years, a 10-year-old flourishes with joy, safety, connection, and mauri (life-force). Every system we seed today must strengthen that child’s world across ancestors → present → descendants.

## Highlights (Attuned across SIS)
- **Body & Mind:** Bio-intelligent wearables + culturally aligned neurotech accelerating recovery and cognitive resilience; “cognitive offload” risks addressed via intentional human-AI co-reasoning.
- **Emotion & Intuition:** Relational AI grounded in whakapapa and co-regulation; interoception and vagal literacy used as design constraints (not afterthoughts).
- **Spirit / Connectedness:** Ethical containers (Temenos Echo) prioritise reciprocity, manaakitanga, and kaitiakitanga in interaction design and data practice.
- **Longevity / Biohacking:** Healthspan signals (circadian, senolytics, epigenetic levers) shift from solo optimisation to community-scale resilience.

## Global & Aotearoa Signals
- **Indigenous AI Governance:** CARE-aligned approaches and Māori data sovereignty inform mauri-centric audits for SIS deployments.
- **Relational Economies:** “Reciprocity clauses” and whakapapa-fit checks begin to appear in platform contracts and product ethics gates.

## Foresight Threads
- **Synthetic Fluency:** Systems that adapt to human rhythm states, not just task prompts; warm-data aware models to protect context and meaning.
- **Human Agency Protection:** Designs that amplify critical thinking, craft, and judgement—antidotes to “self-inflicted AI dementia”.

## Actionable Next Steps
1. **Mauri Audit Pass:** Add a mauri-alignment checklist to all active SIS touchpoints (inputs, models, outputs, feedback loops).  
2. **HEP Dashboard+**: Extend metrics beyond physiology/cognition to include **emotional** and **spiritual vitality** signals.  
3. **Youth Co-Design:** Pilot culturally grounded SIS in schools (Aotearoa first), centring 10-year-old flourishing as the success metric.  
4. **Prototype Wearables:** Build a small POC integrating Indigenous materials + ethical telemetry; publish learnings in this repo.

> Today’s mantra: *Weave mind, machine, and mauri—each thread strengthens tomorrow’s tapestry.*
