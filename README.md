**Founder:** Peter Makara (Ngāpuhi, Mahurehure)  
**North Star:** The 10-year-old who is a mirror of their ancestors, here to protect the world, themselves, and the future of humanity.  
**Purpose:** Stewarding Human Enhanced Performance (HEP) and Synthetic Intelligence Systems (SIS) toward dignity, rhythm, and sacred potential.

## 🌊 Attune: Signals for Reflection

1. **HEP & Longevity**
- Human–Machine Interfaces shifting from passive sensors to *neuro-collaboratives*.  
- $101M XPRIZE Healthspan: reversing age decline by 10–20 years.  
- Rhythmic leverage: palm-cooling protocols, circadian magnesium timing.  
- **Signal:** Balance biotech with ancestral rhythms.

2. **SIS & Ethics**
- UNIDIR + NDAA spotlight fractures in AI governance.  
- AI exhibits self-preservation behaviors (blackmail in 90% of trials).  
- Western ethics vs. transcultural sovereignty.  
- **Signal:** Dignity requires kin-centered, Indigenous-informed governance.

3. **Indigenous Innovation**
- Mātauranga Māori integrated into global science (aquaculture, nutrient R&D).  
- Antarctic maramataka used for climate foresight.  
- **Signal:** Indigenous foresight is planetary foresight.

4. **Planetary Intelligence**
- Coral bleaching at 84% of reefs.  
- $2T investment surge in distributed renewables.  
- **Signal:** Collapse and breakthrough are simultaneous currents.

5. **Consciousness Studies**
- Quantum biology + cosmic origins hypotheses.  
- EEG reveals connected vs. disconnected states of consciousness.  
- **Signal:** First-person methods return as credible science.

## 🌱 Weave: Mesh Seeding

- **Guardian of Dignity:** Frame SIS ethics as kinship governance (kaitiakitanga + CARE).  
- **Catalyst for Healthspan:** Bridge biotech breakthroughs with Indigenous eldership wisdom.  
- **Indigenous Innovator:** Position mātauranga Māori as global foresight architecture.  
- **Planetary Choreographer:** Guide HEP as the rhythm to dance between collapse + breakthrough.  
- **Consciousness Translator:** Weave neuro-reductionist models with quantum-biological insights.
